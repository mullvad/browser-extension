# How to contribute to the Mullvad Privacy Companion extension

The Mullvad Privacy Companion is open sourced for many reasons, but primarily

- we believe the sharing of knowledge will advance the world more quickly and help it to become a
  better place
- we want to allow users to verify that our extension functions as we claim it does, giving them the
  option to build it from source without having to trust our released extensions
- we want to receive contributions from third parties.

## Submitting issues

If you find a bug in the extension's code:

- check first in the issue tracker if a similar bug hasn't been already reported
- add it in the issue tracker.

Please send all other problems or questions **not directly related to the extension's development**
to [support@mullvad.net](mailto:support@mullvad.net). This includes connection issues, questions
regarding your account, and problems with the Mullvad VPN infrastructure or servers.

## Submitting feature requests

If you would like to suggest a feature:

### Process

When you would like to contribute:

- if you want to work on something already in the tracker, comment on the issue first
- if what you want to work on is not in the tracker, file an issue with details.

This is to verify no one else is already working on it, and to make sure we’re still interested in a
given contribution.

Once you receive our confirmation, you are welcome to open a pull request and start working on it.
Once you are ready, we will then review your pull request.

Make sure to follow our [coding guidelines](https://github.com/mullvad/coding-guidelines).
